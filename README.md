As an enthusiastic Data Analyst, I have crafted comprehensive reports using Power BI that provide invaluable insights for various departments, enabling them to make well-informed, data-driven decisions. These reports encompass the domains of Finance, Sales, Supply Chain, and Marketing, and offer an Executive view, meticulously tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across all organizational sectors.

**<h3>Finance View:</h3>** Delve deep into the Profit and Loss statements, analyze the trends in Net Sales Performance, and conduct an examination of top-performing Products and Customers using various criteria.

**<h3>Sales View:</h3>** Immerse yourself in the performance of both Customers and Products. Dissect performance metrics, including Net Sales and Gross Margin percentages, and explore unit economics involving the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and deductions.

**<h3>Marketing View:</h3>** Uncover insights into Product Performance, scrutinize Market, Regional, and Customer Performances. Evaluate the performance of Gross Margin percentages (GM%) and Net Profit percentages (NP%) across different segments. Additionally, delve into unit economics, encompassing COGS, Operational expenses, and Net Profit.

**<h3>Supply Chain View:</h3>** Investigate the accuracy of forecasts, Net Errors, and Absolute Errors, revealing crucial metrics related to Customers based on Forecast Accuracy (FA), Net Error (NE), and Absolute Error (ABS Error). Keep track of trends in Accuracy and Net Error, and explore key metrics related to Products.
